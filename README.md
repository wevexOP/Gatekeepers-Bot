# Gatekeepers Bot

## Welcome to the home of the official Gatekeepers Bot!

The purpose of this bot is to link to API's that will pull data to post game info for communities. This game info will consist of upcoming games to look out for as well as updates for current games. 

The bot will also be able to do a whole host of other commands, and abilities that will become more useful as development continues. 

# Updates

This section is to document the development process with the various features the bot has been programed with. 

## Reply to Keywords

The first implementation of the bot was to get it to reply to keywords that appear when users type and send messages in chat. The bot has also been programed to not reply to itself and can determine if keywords are sent by a user or another bot. 

## Slash Commands

Basics of slash commands have been setup. After some testing the slash commands all work perfectly but have yet to provide any usefulness as there is no real purpose for them yet. More commands to come.

## /add and Options with Slash Commands

Options have been setup withing the slash commands. The options appear when the user types ```/add``` and can then select from a trio of numbers to find the sum of each option. More features to come.
